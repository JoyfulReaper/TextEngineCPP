VERY INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
For now RTFS I guess :\

The directory structure for a game that uses the TextEngine:

  Files to describe the NonPlayableCharacters
(dir) items
  Files to describe the Items and Container Items
(dir) rooms
  Files to describle the Rooms, used to build the Map
(dir) scripts
  startup.lua - optional lua script that is run when the engine is started
