VERY INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
For now RTFS I guess :\

For a description of the Lua API see LuaAPI.h until better documentation is provided


Creating a game:

The directory structure for a game that uses the TextEngine:

./GameName
player.lua - Describes the main Player
(dir) characters
  Files to describe the NonPlayableCharacters
(dir) items
  Files to describe the Items and Container Items
(dir) rooms
  Files to describle the Rooms, used to build the Map
(dir) scripts
  startup.lua - optional lua script that is run when the engine is started
  scripts in this directory can be called from the Lua API.
