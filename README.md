TextEngine 0.0.1
================

TextEngine is a game engine for easily creating interactive text adventure games. Think Zork!

This project aims to provide an easy to use and cross platform mechanism for creating text adventure games using Lua as the sripting language for things such as rooms, items and NPCs. TextEngine is not quite ready, but is nearing an initial alpha release.

This program is intended to be cross platform, however I have little experince building software for platforms other than Linux. If you experince problems building TextEngine on any platform please let me know. You can contact me at xvegan88x __AT_ gmail dOt com

If you find this useful or fun feel free to get me something from my Amazon wishlist :) http://amzn.com/w/2Y6UMLRG23W6W

TextEngine is the biggest project that I have worked on, and I have had fun learning while implementing it. That said while I try to produce the best code it may not be perfect. If you have any suggestions on coding style or any comments about how the engine could have been implemented better I would love to hear your critisim and you can contact me at the above email address. I hope you have as much fun adventuring with TextEngine as I did working on it!
